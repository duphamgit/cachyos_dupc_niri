Open the mockup:

1. Open `mockups/launcher-mockup.html` in your browser (double-click or `file://` URL).
2. The neon halo and pulse are CSS-driven. Edit `mockups/style.css` variables at the top to try different colors/sizes:
   - `--neon`: main glow color
   - `--accent`: secondary accent
   - `--glow-size`: affects outer halo blur distance
   - `--pulse-speed`: pulse animation speed (e.g. `0.8s` -> faster)
   - `--neon-intensity` is referenced conceptually

Want variations (rounded, stronger inner glow, multi-ring glow)? Tell me which style and I'll add more HTML/CSS variants.
